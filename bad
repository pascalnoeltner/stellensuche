Tasks

You don't just want to write software, but understand how to scale modern vehicle software on a global level? In our UX/UI team, you develop solutions that are used worldwide – technically challenging, with direct impact and the opportunity to network within Mercedes-Benz.

Mercedes-Benz stands for premium vehicles with state-of-the-art technology. Our goal is to be the leader in electromobility and vehicle software – and to create extraordinary user experiences. Our UX/UI software development team works with colleagues from all over the world on the next generation of connected vehicle systems. We focus on technical excellence, open communication and independent work.

You support our CI/CD and release engineering team in the continuous development of our software infrastructure. You'll work on processes that use over 200 developers worldwide – with the latest tools, clear quality goals and space for your own technical ideas. 

Your tasks:

    Development and optimization of complex CI/CD processes with GitLab CI – including containerization, automated testing and intelligent error analysis
    (Optional) Use of AI tools to improve build performance, test coverage and automation
    Create meaningful dashboards for analyzing performance, test and release data
    Support in developing internal tools and AI chatbots to support our developers
    Close cooperation with architects, product owners and globally distributed Dev teams

Your contribution counts: Your solutions help make software more efficient, reliable and scalable – for real-life applications in the vehicle. You won't just run along – you're designing.

The internship can begin from September 2025.
